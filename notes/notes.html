                    <p>You know, when you want to listen to some piano ambient music. Maybe it will sound with a rain or
                        some noises. And you listen to it, and listen to it, and listen... to it. Ten minutes, half an
                        hour, hour, two, the same track with a simple ambience. It's a magic, isn't it? To fall too deep
                        into the feeling of another world, which you create while listening. </p>
                    <p>I still forget about that not only I can feel as deep as I think. People around the world will
                        play damn youtube video on loop to feel life. To feel what feelings goins around them. And today
                        I discovered this feeling in The Bear. The episode was the start of the third season and was
                        expected to be anything but what I watched.
                    <p>They did the thing. They put you in the this damn "piano and rain youtube" video on loop. You
                        watching it and it never stops, never. And you think to yourself - why did they do this? Why did
                        they even put fades between the same track as you listening it as youtube video? And the answer
                        is because it was the best to convey the feeling of character's past. You're into the zone, you
                        can't escape or remove yourself from this state. Your mind is weak to it and just flows on.
                        There is greatness here.</p>
